  Search for a Book: Search for books in the library's collection based on various criteria like title, author, and ISBN.
  Register as a User: Allow new users to register with the library, generating unique user IDs for identification.
  Save and Load Data: Automatically save and load library data, including books, users, and their interactions, to/from files for data persistence between program sessions.
